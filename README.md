The Hasee Bounce Game is a simple and fun web-based game where the player tries to catch falling doughnutfruits while avoiding dungs. 
The player controls a basket at the bottom of the screen and must move it left and right to catch the good fruits and avoid the bad ones. 
The game gets progressively more challenging as the fruits fall faster.

How to Play:
- Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the basket left and right
- Catch the good fruits to earn points. Each fruit has a different point value.
- Avoid catching the bad fruits and dung, as they will deduct points or end the game
